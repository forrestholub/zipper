# zipper
*Overview:*
this tool zips .isf files in a directory and renames to w/e

*What it does:*
•	7 zips all .isf files in a directory. Just open up PowerShell in the directory you want to zip and just run the program “zipper.ps1”
•	If you don’t have the 7z, the script automatically download and install the program for use.

*Dependencies:*
•	You need to add the zipper.ps1 path to environment variable
•         If you have trouble executing ps1 files, let me know, you may just need to enable from command prompt. I’ve listed this below for easy access:
A.      Start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as Administrator" option. Only members of the Administrators group on the computer can change the execution policy.
B.      Enable running unsigned scripts by entering:
                             i.   set-executionpolicy remotesigned
